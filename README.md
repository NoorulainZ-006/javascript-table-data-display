# 🎓 Semester Result Webpage

## 📘 Overview
This project is a simple and elegant webpage that displays a student’s semester result in a clean and well-styled table format.  
It presents course-wise marks and GPA in a visually organized layout.  
The design uses a soft **cyan-green theme** for a calm and professional look.

## 🧩 Features
- Displays **student name** and **semester title** at the top.  
- Shows a **table of all subjects** with mids, sessional, final, total, obtained marks, and GPA.  
- Has a **consistent table theme** with dark headers and light cyan body.  
- Rows highlight with a soft green shade when hovered.  
- Includes a **final remarks section** that shows summarized performance.

## 🖋️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** for styling and color theme  
- **JavaScript** for dynamic functionality

## 💻 How It Works
1. The student’s subject details are written manually in the HTML table.  
2. The JavaScript file (`script.js`) processes and displays transformed or summarized data in the “Final Remarks” section.  
3. The layout and color theme ensure the table is easy to read and visually appealing.
